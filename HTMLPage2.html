                            The instability of the power grid is largely depends on the eignvalue of the system matrix, and the sensitivity of the eignvalue
                            can somehow explain the reason of the instability in system. Practically speaking, numerical method are largely applied in the 
                            calculation of the eignvalue sensitivity. Under this project, we firstly use the real step differential method and complex step
                            differential method to verify the speed of these two methods. It turns out that the complex step differential method are becoming
                            instable when the rank of the system matrix is larger than 5, while real step differential method always perform well. Moreover,
                            interpolation and integral operator method are also compared in this project.

                            After finish the previous verification, We continue on analysing the signal extraction method in LFO(Low Frequency Oscillation). 
                            In this project, Prony method and HHT(Hilbert-Huang Transformation) are applied. Prony shows a great merit in the sinusodial signal
                            extraction. However, its noise immunity performs unsatisfying compare to other method. From the experiment, the Prony method only works
                            under the SNR is greater than 100dB, which is impossible to reach in industry. HHT method, also is more complex than the Prony method, 
                            performs well under the noise and shows a error under 10^-15! Thus, our conclusion is that HHT method will become popular in the future
                            power system analysis.

                            Among the modern university student, the unbalanced dietary and awful nutrition arrangement has sharply contrast to
                            the high nutritious demand for intelletual work. In this project, we tend to analysis the ingredient of the food in 
                            university's canteen and works out a model that satisfied the daily nutrition demand given by the Food Guide Pyramid 
                            through the linear programming method includes the linear optimization and goal programming. Moreover, considering 
                            that under the restriction given by DRIs and Food Guide Pyramid there are many available solutions, we tend to make
                            the diatery recommandation more diverse by set a preference for each user. Also includes the approach of 0-1 method since that
                            some food are indivisable, we finally works out a reasonable dietary recommandation for the whole campus.

                            This graduate essay is mainly focus on solving the oscillation mode identification problem and oscillation source 
                            location problem in low-frequency oscillation based on Empirical Mode Decomposition. Compared with other nowadays algorithm, 
                            The Empirical Mode Decomposition not only shows an adequately faster calculating speed and higher noise immunity, 
                            but also enables the extraction of the instantaneous parameters of the signal, including instantaneous frequency and instantaneous amplitude. 
                            And eventually I work out the appliance of the EMD in the process of oscillation mode identification.
                            Because the force oscillation theory is believed to explain the origin of the low-frequency oscillation appropriately, 
                            I choose to use the traditional energy function algorithm to locate the oscillation source. 
                            Both the theory and the simulation proves that it is capable for oscillation source location. 
                            Since there is always noise in the real power system, I try to combine the EMD with the traditional energy function algorithm in order to decrease the effect of the noise.
                            Simulation results proves that it is more efficient compared to traditional energy function algorithm.
